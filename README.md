# CODSOFT Internship Projects
This repository contains the projects I developed during my front-end internship at CODSOFT from July 1 to July 30. The tasks include:

Portfolio Website: A personal portfolio showcasing my projects and skills.
Matcha Website: A landing page project for a fictional green tea brand named Matcha. This project helped me learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. I focused on design aspects such as alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and overall visual appeal.
Calculator: A functional calculator application.
Throughout these tasks, I emphasized design and usability to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
